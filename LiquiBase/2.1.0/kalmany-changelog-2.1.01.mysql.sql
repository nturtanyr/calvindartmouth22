The Kalmany Electoral Commission is still incredibly secretive about its background operations and the members of its board are even more elusive to the point where nobody is certain who exactly they are. Could it be they have ulterior motives?</p><p>This couple with the fact that there are going to be electoral incentives make it seems like the entire political system is a game to be played where there are winners and losers. But this is a democracy! The only losers are the people in Kalmany. Can we trust KEC to not toy with our lives?</p><p>There''s hubbub about what the incentive might well be and rumours are circulating that they''ll be <b>specialised buildings and/or construction projects, that boost or engage certain facets of the constituency.</b> What the requirements will be to win the privilege is unknown at this point.</p><p>Should they even be part of the political system? Don''t they deserve to be voted on alike every other policy we are implementing!? I say yes, we shouldn''t be allowing such a mysterious trust to manage our country''s infrastructure.

Now we''re going to see members of parliaments acting <b>out of their own personal alignment, and for what their party believes in instead</b>.

Yet in the months we''ve had of assemblies, not a single policy has been passed to ensure more hospitals are built in this neglected region.</p><p>I think that the KEC needs to take a closer look in what exactly they want from our political system. Do we want further representation? Or do we just want chaos where nobody can tell what will happen next?</p><p>This is Ian saying, don''t feed the fire!</p>');

Citizens gathered at the City of Kalbal outside the Kalbal Blue House and forcibly entered the building to remove him. He was then taken into custody by the Kalbal police force and will await for trial and sentencing.</p><p>The reasons for the citizen has been reported on for months; the election that put him into office, some are saying was orchestrated and was more a performance than a legitimate election. Far more votes were counted for Dylan than there were citizens of Kalmany. There is also the issue that Dylan Witterberger was far down the polls, due to his involvement with the Kalman Royal Family, particularly Princess Corynne.</p><p>During his time in office, widespread legislation was enacted in a random and erratic manner by the president, and caused a great manner of unrest, including criminalising wearing socks, loitering, and public trumpet playing. The latter caused great upset with Shire''s local Public Brass Band, and caused half of their troupe to be arrested during their annual performance at the ASDFGHIJKL Festival.</p><p>The forcible removal of Dylan was headed by several individual who name themselves the Free Party, and are determined to provide freedom to the Kalmans. There is some controversy over their methods, including a strange fascination with the zodiac monuments scattered about Kalmany in its various constituencies, and the ceremonies they impart on new initiates into the party. Their leader, Eyron Vames, declined to comment on the operation, or what happens next.</p><p>Constituencies will be expected to run their constituencies without top level help in the meantime until a decision is made. The citizens of Kalmany are still at unrest but are advised to stay at home by the Kabal Police Department and the Free Party, until the government is reinstated.</p><p>There is no word on what occurred with the nuclear power plants that had been commissioned by the president during his time in office. There is no news on what happened to the previous president Marie Hanner. There is no news on why the wind farms being built have five prongs instead of the usual three. There is still no news on what happened to the moon. President Dylan''s ousting has left many questions unresolved and we can only hope that they are answered when the new government is in place.</p>', '<p>President Dylan''s term in office caused an uproar that resulted in him being forced out of office at a demonstation in the City of Kalbal.

It''s said that the board members are formed from some of Dylan''s original governmental employees but the true identities of its board are being left unannounced to protect their privacy. Its unknown how many people are part of the KEC but after months of the government being out of action, the citizens of Kalmany are glad to have things on track.</p><p>The KEC is currently employing several web-developers and IT engineers in a new project that will determine the fate of Kalmany''s government in future. The KUBC recently took a statement from a spokesperson for the KEC:</p><p>"We''re excited to manage the reforms and we''re certain that the changes will be for the better. Our design principles will be transparency, democracy, and engagement. These were the qualities lacking in the last election cycle and we''re determined to ensure such a thing will not happen again."</p><p>The spokesperson did not commit that the reference was to ex-president''s Dylan''s attempts to circumvent the political system during his time in office. It also did not commit that the Kalman Royal Family, who have seem to have disappeared from the public eye, had any involvement. There is some talk that Princess Corynne, who was said to be personally involved with Dylan, had some say in the choices for the KEC''s board members but these are unsubstantiated.</p><p>The citizens of Kalmany are proving restless as they have had their constituencies providing most of the government administration during the hiatus between ex-president Dylan''s ousting and the formation of the KEC. It seems the events have shone a light into the inefficiencies of the constituency administration and many are complaining about various practises, including using bears in the police force, constructing so many lighthouses, using farms as the main form of waste disposal, and supposedly ignoring the environmental changes occurring around them.</p><p>"Something big is coming," said one concerned citizen. Many citizens have turned to this thinking, and the new religious belief of "Something" is seeing a rise in involvement. The KEC declined to comment.</p>', '<p>The KEC has formed to helped reform the election system and ensure fair elections in the future.

The website (visitable at https://www.kalmany.org) has data on Kalmany''s constituencies, candidates who have decided to stand for election, a real-time calculation of votes counted at the ballot centers, and a live feed to the Kalmany Parliamentary Assembly.</p><p>The motivations for the new website are to ensure that the election process is transparent, an issue that was widely publicised and criticised when President Dylan was elected last year. While there are still facets of the election process that are hidden, the KEC has publicly said that it will strive to ensure that the elections are transparent and preserves the most important factor; that Kalmany''s citizens have a say in how their country is run.</p><p>The KEC has had issues in the past, with citizens concerned that the identities of the board members are kept secret and that there is no voice of the people involved in organising the elections.</p><p>"These concerns are reasonable," stated a spokesperson for the KEC, "and rest assured that any concerns are heard by the board. The important thing is that not every decision can operate using democracy, else you will very easily fall into cyclical logic and end up with an infinity. And nobody likes infinity."</p><p>Some of the major issues effecting Kalmany is the huge discrepancy between quality of life in the twenty-four constituencies. Many people are without homes while the next constituency may have many uninhabited buildings. Healthcare, Education and Transport are just some of the sectors that are polled daily to understand their current levels of efficiency. This data is also being made available on the KEC''s website.</p><p>There is talk that the KEC is planning to improve engagement by creating a competition out of the elections. Some say this serves no purpose other than turning the elections into some sort of game. The KEC has made no comment to KUBC after attempting to reach out.</p><p>The current whereabouts of Dylan Witterberger, the ex-president who first began the conversations into reforming the election process, is still unknown. Police have stated there is no investigation underway leading people to believe he is safe and is simply eluding press.</p>', '<p>The KEC has launched their new website to provide transparency to the people of Kalmany on the status of elections, the activities of the parliamentary assemblies, daily polling of the government''s efficiency.

The political parties are to help candidates band together to collate resources and fight policies in the parliamentary assembly as a united force. Applications are already being made for parties and are under review by the KEC before they will accept them and display them in their website.</p><p>The Kalmany Electoral Commission has stated it believes that, "the introduction of political parties should improve engagement and allow for candidates that unite under a common cause to fight for the policies they believe in, and dampen the efforts of those they oppose. We believe this will help properly reflect the opinions of the citizens of Kalmany more effectively."</p><p>There are some who believe such a change will instead provide chaos into an already complicated political system. After all, the American founder George Washington was against the idea and formation of political parties.</p><p>"I think I''m going to get rather more confused," said one confused citizen, "I already can''t tell if a person truly represents my opinions and beliefs, how can I be certain when they may be acting in the interest of their party?"</p><p>The Free Party, who assisted in deposing President Dylan, is in support of the formation, and its likely we will see them spring up when support surges again. Eyron Vames, current leader of the Free Party, now an organisation named the Free Peoples of Kalmany, commented, "I hope to see citizens pour in support of our efforts to ensure that Kalmany is for the people and run by the people!". He made no comment on whether we would see a candidate from the Free Party anytime soon in Kalmany''s elections.</p><p>Nonetheless, applications are being sent to the KEC for approval, including the Black Party, the Snarling Teeth Party, and the Leopards Eating People''s Faces Party. Whether or not they will be approved will remain to be seen, but the KEC assures us that "legitimate unions will be registered."</P>', '<p>The Kalmany Electoral Commission has approved legislation to allow the formation of political parties and applications are arriving for numerous new political parties. The move is intended to improve assembly discussions and facilitate strength in frustrated voters.</p>');
